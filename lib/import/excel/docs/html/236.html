It doesn’t take many flips through any of the Sonnax
Transmission Specialties® catalogs to notice that we
offer many valve assemblies with various ratios. What
is a ratio, why do we have so many, and is it important to
consider during a rebuild?
</p>


<p class="body">
For the purposes of this discussion, “ratio” can be
defined as the relationship in size between two or
more similar parts. For a typical boost valve available
in different diameters, it is the ratio between the boost
valve reaction area and the reaction area on the
regulating valve. Anybody familiar with rebuilding
Toyota valve bodies has discovered that most
applications have enough different-sized boost valve
assemblies to make your head spin. The parts look the
same initially, but the valve spools measure differently
in size for different vehicles. Not that this is an Asian
phenomenon – all the OEMs have designed units in
this manner.

</p>

<p class="body">
The two primary reasons why the OEMs do this is to
save money and increase flexibility. A particular
transmission (03-72LE, 4L60-E, etc.) can be used in
various vehicle models, each having different needs in
regard to torque capacity, horsepower, shift feel, and
other factors. For example, a 4L60-E transmission was
used in an Isuzu Hombre (1999) with a 2.2L,
4-cylinder engine having 120 horsepower (HP) and
140 ft-lbs of torque. The same unit was also used in a
5.7L, V8 Pontiac GTO requiring 350 HP and
365 ft-lbs of torque. With such widely varying torque
ratings, the transmission requires different clutch
and/or band holding capacities, which in turn require
different main line pressures.
</p>

<p class="body">
One simple and inexpensive method for achieving
different line pressure curves is to vary the main
pressure regulator boost valve spool ratios. The typical
boost assembly is used to increase line pressure by
providing an additional force, influenced by throttle
and reverse gear pressure, so that when high torque
conditions are required, line pressure is raised. By
altering the size of the boost valve spool diameters, the
manufacturer can use hydraulic pressure on the
various valve spool areas (force = pressure x area) to
tailor the line pressure curve to a specific application.
In most instances, these valve spool size changes can
be accomplished without changing the outside
diameter of the boost sleeves, thus allowing the same
basic valve body or pump casting to be used in all
vehicle applications. This, of course, represents a huge
cost savings in regard to tooling and redundant part
inventory.

<p class="body">
Figures 1, 2 and 3 illustrate how changes in the boost
valve ratios affect the line pressure curve in a 4L60-E.

In Figure 1, the boost valve is shown and sizes
indicated for the torque signal (ØA) and reverse (ØB)
spools for the small and large OEM valve ratios, as well
as the Sonnax improved ratio. The graphs in Figures 2
and 3 show that as the valve spool sizes increase (or as
the ratio between the boost valve and the pressure
regulator get larger in this instance), higher line
pressures in Drive and Reverse are achieved.
<img src="236_images/figure_3.jpg" class="articleimage">
</p>

<p class="body">
So, for vehicles with higher torque capacity or
requiring increased performance, a larger ratio valve
should be considered. In many instances when the
OEM makes multiple ratios, Sonnax will make the
largest or most popular size, or design a ratio for even
higher line pressure if the unit is in need of more
holding capacity.

<p class="body">
A common rebuild procedure is to alter the pressure
regulator valve spring in order to change line pressure.
While this modification does adjust line pressure, it
should be noted that the slope of the pressure curve
does not change, but rather it is offset by the same
amount at both the low and high ends of the range
(see Figure 4). By replacing an OEM 4L60-E large
pressure regulator valve spring with a stronger spring,
it can be seen that line pressure is increased by the same
amount, regardless of throttle pressure influence.
</p>

<p class="body">
Changing boost valve sizes and pressure regulator
springs both have benefits, but when considering your
part options, the important thing is to be aware of how
they are different. Changing springs will generally
increase pressure a consistent amount, while a larger
boost valve will have a greater effect at high pressure
and a lesser effect at low pressures.
</p>

<p class="body">

In the 4L60-E boost assembly, the
larger valve ratios result in higher
line pressure. This is because the
larger valves have more reaction
area to counter the pressure
regulator valve, which stays the
same diameter. However, a larger
spool size does not always indicate
higher boost or pressure. For
instance, in the 4T60-E MTV
boost valve assembly, the valve
with the smaller spool diameter is
considered the “high” ratio,
resulting in higher pressures
(see Figure 5). This is because modulator
pressure is reacting on the
difference between spools A and B.
Assuming that spring forces and
balance line area stay the same
between the low and high ratio
assemblies, modulator pressure
would be acting on a larger area for
the high ratio with the smaller valve spool. So the
resultant regulated line pressure would be higher when
using the boost valve with a smaller diameter. When
swapping ratios during rebuilds, these forces and diameters
should be examined closely to ensure that the
desired effect is achieved.
</p>

<p class="body">
Accumulator control valves are another location where
we find multiple valve ratios. The E4OD/4R100 and
4L60 & E/200-4R use various sized (different ratios)
accumulator control valves to influence shift feel. As
seen in the oil circuits in Figures 6 and 7, these Ford
and GM valves are very similar in function. Throttle
pressure, via EPC boost or torque signal, is used to
influence the accumulator control pressure on the
resisting side of the accumulator piston. Figure 8 shows
the effect of these different valve ratios on the
E4OD/4R100 and AX4N. The pressure curves show
that as the plunger size is increased, the accumulator
pressure control rises, which would result in quicker
and firmer shifts.

There are many other valve applications in which the
OEMs use multiple valve ratios to tune a control
pressure to best suit various vehicle applications. The
AX4N bypass clutch control sleeve and plunger valve
kit (pictured on page 152) has two known OEM valve
ratios to adjust converter clutch apply. The 4R100
low/reverse modulator sleeve and plunger valve kit
(pictured on page 167) also has two known OEM valve
ratios to adjust the holding capacity on the low/reverse
clutch. Care should be exercised when replacing any
worn sleeves in these locations, because using the
wrong-sized valve for the vehicle could result in
converter apply/release complaints (AX4N) or burned
low/reverse clutches (4R100).

In some instances, Sonnax creates increased ratio
replacement parts that provide pressures greater than
the OEM design. These parts are typically created in
order to overcome a chronic complaint or failure with
the original design, or for heavy duty or performance
applications. One example of this is the 77754-03K
4L60-E TCC regulator valve kit, shown on
page 26. This slightly undersized valve (Ø.400"
vs. Ø.440" stock) changes the ratio between
the isolator and regulator valve, resulting in
slightly increased TCC apply rate. This Sonnax
modified valve ratio has approximately 10
percent higher TCC apply pressure, and has
proven to be very successful on pre-EC3 units
to overcome the common 1870 slip code set by
low regulated converter apply pressure.
</p>

<p class="body">
It should be noted that when Sonnax offers an
oversized valve (pressure regulator, bypass
control valve, etc.) for an application in order
to refurbish the bore and eliminate wear, that
all pressures and valve spool ratios have been
considered. This is to eliminate any significant
pressure changes as a result, and ensures that no
adverse shift feel or component apply/release
complaints will occur.
</p>

<p class="body">
These same basic concepts of
apply size vs. performance
can be transferred to servo
assemblies. As noted previously,
on vehicles with larger
engines, increased torque and
therefore component holding
capacity is required. For
example, GM designed three
different 2nd apply piston
ratios for the 4L60 & E. Like
the 4T60-E MTV boost
valve mentioned previously,
smaller means more area.
When looking at the cross
section of this servo assembly
(see Figure 9), it is easy to see
how a smaller piston “A”
diameter results in larger
apply surface area and
increased holding pressure
and force on the band.
<img src="236_images/figure_9.gif" class="articleimage">
</p>

<p class="body">
What might not be as obvious with this assembly is that the 2nd apply piston also functions as an accumulator
for 3rd gear. The 3rd gear apply pressure and the servo return spring act on the release side of the 2nd apply
piston to overcome 2nd clutch oil during a 2-3 shift. So the ratio between the apply and release side of the piston
becomes critical to band and clutch timing. For optimal band release, the relationship between apply and release
pressure forces on the servo must be maintained so that the servo release (3rd gear side) always has a greater force
than the apply side. For many of the transmissions commonly used in high performance applications, Sonnax
has designed “Super Hold” servo assemblies (see Figure 10) to provide significantly increased holding capacities
and maintain optimal apply/release relationships.
</p>

<p class="body">
So when rebuilding a transmission, whether for street or high performance applications, take some time to ensure
that the correct valve and servo ratios are being used for the specific vehicle. The durability and drivability of the
transmission will be improved, and both you and your customer will be happier as a result.
