      <p>The Power Train Saver is a patented drivetrain protection device that mounts into your existing driveshaft. Once installed, this device prevents over-torque damage that can ruin differentials, gears, axles and driveshafts. In an over-torque situation, our precisely calibrated Torque Fuses<sup>&reg;</sup> shear before drivetrain damage occurs, while the unit design holds the driveshaft in place.</p>
      <p>Using a Power Train Saver doesn't just cut down on expensive drivetrain repairs. Consider the collateral damage from a broken driveshaft such as leaking or broken hydraulic lines, damaged fuel tanks, punctured air lines, etc. Then calculate the costly downtime of waiting for a wrecker and making repairs, and the benefits of installing a Power Train Saver quickly add up.</p>
