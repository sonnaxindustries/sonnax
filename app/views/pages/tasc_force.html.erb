    <h2>True collaboration toward a common goal is not something you see everyday, but that is what the Sonnax TASC Force is all about.</h2>
	<div class="photo half"><p>The Sonnax Technical Automotive Specialties Committee (TASC) Force is composed of experienced transmission rebuilders and technicians who value technical innovations and have hands-on understanding of the latest units and industry developments. From around the globe, the best minds in the transmission industry willingly share their know-how, with the understanding that everyone benefits when good ideas and products emerge from centuries of combined transmission wisdom.</p>
    
      
      <p><%= image_tag('tascforce-small.jpg', :width => 108, :height => 68, :alt => 'TASC Force') %>When you see the TASC Force logo on a Sonnax product, it means the product has passed stringent testing by Sonnax and by TASC Force member shops.</p>
    </div>
	<p>Independent TASC members work for large shops, small shops, volume transmission and volume valve body rebuilders. Alongside Sonnax engineers and specialists, they are helping to develop repairs which will be used by their companies and by the rest of the transmission aftermarket.</p>
	<p>TASC Force members contribute product ideas, test new products, troubleshoot results, and get together on a regular basis to listen, discuss and compare findings. Their efforts help provide answers and repairs for the entire industry. Everybody wins.</p>
