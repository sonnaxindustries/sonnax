<h1>TASC Force</h1>
<p>The Sonnax TASC Force plays an invaluable role in identifying the root causes of transmission problems and supporting the development of transmission products for the automotive aftermarket industry. The TASC Force is composed of experienced transmission rebuilders and technicians who value technical innovations and have hands-on understanding of the latest units and industry developments. Working closely with Sonnax design engineers and technicians, TASC Force members contribute product ideas, test new products, trouble-shoot results, and get together on a regular basis to listen, discuss, and compare findings. They willingly share their know-how, with the understanding that everyone benefits when good ideas and products emerge from centuries of combined transmission wisdom.</p>
<p>When you see the &#8220;TASC Force Approved&#8221; logo on a Sonnax product, it means the product has passed stringent testing by Sonnax and by TASC Force member shops. &#8220;TASC Force Approved&#8221; provides added assurance that this part has been studied, tested and endorsed by some of the most savvy technicians and rebuilders in the industry.</p>
