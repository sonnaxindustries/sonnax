This valve body retainer plate easily bolts into place on cracked plates, clamping the separator plate and gasket securely to prevent future leaks and clutch failure. The kit installs in minutes and requires no special tools.</p>

The larger apply area provides more holding power and more positive shifts. Dual seals prevent piston scuffing and reduce leakage by 15% to help maintain line pressure and converter charge.</p>

By combining Teflon<sup>&reg;</sup> outer seals, rubber D-ring seals and an anodized aluminum piston, Sonnax has not only improved sealing and strength of this piston, but also eliminated the common metal ring and plastic piston breakage.</p>
