          <p>The Power Train Saver is a unique drivetrain protection device that can be used on virtually anything that is shaft driven. When an over-torque situation occurs, a system of shear pins called Torque Fuses will shear while the PTS unit continues to hold the shaft in position, avoiding damage to expensive driveline components. This is a must for applications where downtime is not acceptable. In addition, Sonnax offers a complete line of aluminum driveshaft components and tubing for the driveline industry</p>
