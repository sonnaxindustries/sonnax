Priority One:
1. Remove paperclip plugin from parts and assets, and create script to put images back in place. This way we can continue to work with images as the previous site did - with the filesystem
2. VBFix file will be replaced with the new VB Fix file once that process is complete.
3. Add focus() call to quick search
4. Add table to map new parts to old parts, then in the part search (single) and part detail page it will check the redirector first
CheckPartRedirector.for_part(part_name) - this will simply check against part_redirects (id, old_part_id, new_part_id) table and if the part number matches an old part, redirect to the new part (URL)? Or, render the page with the new part intercepted with a note that the part was a previous Product Line Part. If @part.redirected? then show_message else continue end

EXTERNAL NOTES:
- Publication importer needs to use old product line IDS with _model_record
- Task to push shared assets (DONE)
- Task to clear out shared assets (DONE) - Do this before importer and when pushing to the server
- Product Line -> Part, Unit -> Product Line, Make -> Unit - How to get make out of a part?
- Main import script to do everything in order
- Paperclip naming path (ID or url_friendly)
- Update admin with new parts and attributes
- Import parts DISTINCT by product line (group?)
- Featured parts rotators
- Specs for associations and named_scopes
- URL FRIENDLY module with associated tests

We have distinct product lines
We have distinct parts

We have parts inside of product lines. If I were to view a product line, it would show all parts associated to the product line.

We have distinct makes
We have distinct units

We have units inside of product lines. When inside of a different product line, they represent a different reference figure.

We have units attached to makes. If I were to view a make, it would show all associated units. We have to query backwards to get all makes for specified units in a product line.

--------------------
PARTS FOR PRODUCT LINE / MAKE / UNIT
SELECT *
FROM units u
LEFT JOIN unit_makes um ON um.unit_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN makes m ON um.make_id = m.id
WHERE m.id = 27 AND u.product_line = 2
---------------------

DISTINCT UNIT NAMES AND COUNTS
SELECT `name`, COUNT(`name`) AS cnt
FROM units u
GROUP BY `name`
HAVING count(cnt) > 1
ORDER BY cnt DESC

Exporting the DB for Sonnax. Once we have this object, we can define formatters and she can export in whatever format she would like.

Distributors have addresses

SITE NOTES:
- SEO is somewhat low on priorities, as they have the exposure and audience. Let's just get this cleaned up and more organized to view and make sense of.
- Internal search is high priority, as they want to be able to search the entire internal site. Currently using Google Search for this, but that takes people out of context.
- Product Catalog is high priority
- Per discussion with David, he wants to put the emphasis on creating a better experience so people don't have to contact, versus relying on contact methods

- parts should be made available by default, then use search/filter to refine the parts. There needs to be a 'browse'

**
- Get the Part Summary outside of a PDF, and into the website. This would be a long term task
  - This assumes people can view PDF's, or have permission to view PDF's

UX:
- Different Layouts and options for main sections. This can be confusing for users who want to scan or find parts. IE: Once section has a part finder, the other is a PDF of a catalog.
- Email for Quote should be in page (JS) that can bind down when they want to receive a quote. Get their name, phone number, email?
- Find a distributor. This should be attached to all products that are not sold directly to the end user. **
- Part summary and instructions could be separate tabs for people to get the information.
- PDF downloads as a secondary action
- Speed order available for only a subset??
  - Can we show a cart icon? how can someone view their cart if they want to jump from page to page?
- Search and search results are inconsistent between each section. There should be a 'search' - which is a plain text, and then an advanced search.
- Ordering options should be on the part detail page when ordering is available. If it's not available, then show the distributor finder
  - Distributor
  - Speed Order
  - Email for Quote
- Navigation naming
- Videos using a standard video player to stream, not requiring a plugin.
- Catalog request. Could this be on every page?
  - Full page to catalog order
  - Email sign up, checkbox versus a second page
- Inconsistency of news/events. Can we move these off of wordpress, and give a quick custom admin for this?
- Contact us, checkbox for the email insider to automatically subscribe them in the background?

- Using Blog 'Pages' versus actual items, which means links are not linking directly to the article. Current homepage is an example.
- Inconsistent Navigation


ASSETS FOR PARTS:
- Installation Instructions
- Catalog
- Demonstration Videos

FIND A DISTRIBUTOR
- Geolocation search

  - List by State
  - Sort by alphabetical, then order (then most parts?)
- Distributor detail page
  - Title
  - Url
  - Address
  - Phone Number
  - CTA to contact the distributor
  - Parts listing??
  - Google Maps API integration
- Search index for distributors
- Enter postal code and then search?
- Select Country from drop down?

SPEED ORDER (Login?)

API DATABASE:
- twitter
- flickr?
- constant_contact (use this to properly segment data, as well as tie this into a login system for users)
  - subscription queue in a background job?
  - Process directly to CC and also add into the system?
  - Process directly to CC, and then sync with CC?
  - How can users integrate?

- Should be able to get a catalog without registering. If registered, then information is prefilled.

TODO (2010-02-03)
- jQuery and AJAX adding of makes and such before saving

MEETING NOTES (2010-01-25 9:00AM with David McGee)
There is an ERP system, but it is not connected to the website in any fashion. (NK: What about simply retrieving a database of products?)

Product Market Segments
* Transmission Parts
* Torque Converter Parts
* Power Train Savers / Driveline Parts
  - This is a different market than the first 2 sections
  - Fleet and driveline shops
* High performance parts
  - This is a subset of the first 2 sections
  - The market for this is different than the first 2
    - "A guy building a transmission for a friend"
    - "A guy building a transmission for a trailer"
  - These parts are sold directly to the consumer, not through a distributor

Distributors
- Not always educated on all of Sonnax's catalog
- They do not promote Sonnax's products

Main Markets: The market is very specific and very niche. If someone has worked with transmissions, they have heard of Sonnax. The parts are very need specific.
- Automatic Transmission Repair Shops
- Quick Lube would be at the bottom of this chain
- There are a select group of 'Fanboys' who help to promote their products.

Torque Converter Group: This is the link between the engine and transmission. They share the fluid from the transmission.
- Many are re-built in factories
- Re-builders range in size, from small shops to big names.
- Sonnax will sell to these people directly
- Online catalog is very important for this set of people, as they can order via email on the website.
- They can place quick orders, as well as maintain a cart. (NK: Could this be confusing to a user, who can add some items to their cart, while others are for distributors?)

Sharing of Technical Information: This section is about disseminating technical knowledge and information. It suffers in that it lacks context of the rest of the site, and assumes knowledge of the contents of the PDF documents
- Products in the catalog have instructions for installation.
- Reamers
- Vacuum testing guidelines
- Kits

Events
- These are primarily used and geared towards the distributors who will also be at many of the events they will be attending

News
- This gets updated about once a month, and in many cases will mirror the press releases that they send to trade magazines

Weaknesses of the current site
- The product catalog is structured for sales. It is too fragmented in the wrong places.
  - EX: Someone coming to look for transmissions many not realized it's in 'High Performance Parts', and therefore not find what they are looking for.
- The language may sometimes carry a myopic view of the company
- There are many ways to contact Sonnax, but this is seen as a symptom of a bigger problem: people can't find what they are looking for on the current website.
