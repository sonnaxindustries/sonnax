SITE NOTES:
- SEO is somewhat low on priorities, as they have the exposure and audience. Let's just get this cleaned up and more organized to view and make sense of.
- Internal search is high priority, as they want to be able to search the entire internal site. Currently using Google Search for this, but that takes people out of context. 
- Product Catalog is high priority
- Per discussion with David, he wants to put the emphasis on creating a better experience so people don't have to contact, versus relying on contact methods

**
- Get the Part Summary outside of a PDF, and into the website. This would be a long term task
  - This assumes people can view PDF's, or have permission to view PDF's

UX:
- Different Layouts and options for main sections. This can be confusing for users who want to scan or find parts. IE: Once section has a part finder, the other is a PDF of a catalog.
- Email for Quote should be in page (JS) that can bind down when they want to receive a quote. Get their name, phone number, email?
- Find a distributor. This should be attached to all products that are not sold directly to the end user. **
- Part summary and instructions could be separate tabs for people to get the information.
- PDF downloads as a secondary action
- Speed order available for only a subset??
  - Can we show a cart icon? how can someone view their cart if they want to jump from page to page?
- Search and search results are inconsistent between each section. There should be a 'search' - which is a plain text, and then an advanced search.
- Ordering options should be on the part detail page when ordering is available. If it's not available, then show the distributor finder
  - Distributor
  - Speed Order
  - Email for Quote
- Navigation naming
- Videos using a standard video player to stream, not requiring a plugin.
- Catalog request. Could this be on every page? 
  - Full page to catalog order
  - Email sign up, checkbox versus a second page
- Inconsistency of news/events. Can we move these off of wordpress, and give a quick custom admin for this?
- Contact us, checkbox for the email insider to automatically subscribe them in the background?

- Using Blog 'Pages' versus actual items, which means links are not linking directly to the article. Current homepage is an example.
- Inconsistent Navigation
